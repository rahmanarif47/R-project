most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 8000 movies or
tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 200M
Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the
movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast,
directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc. ### Goals The goal is to clean
the data, do some EDA, make pretty graphs and charts, maybe finally will gain
some insight about the data, including: 1) Understanding what content is
available in different countries 2) Identifying similar content by matching
text-based features 3) Network analysis of Actors / Directors and find
interesting insights 4) Does Netflix has more focus on TV Shows than movies in
recent years. 5) Has Duration of movies over the years increased or decreased.
6) Compare ratings of TV Shows and Movies and determine how they are rated. ##
Data Cleaning First, let's just load the data!
```{r cars}
# Load data
netflix <- read.csv("netflix_titles.csv")
head(netflix)
str(netflix)
```
And we want to view the summary of dataset before we start cleaning.
```{r}
summary(netflix)
```
From the summary above we discovered some columns are not formatted correctly.
- type
- country
- date_added
- release_year
- rating
- listed_in
```{r}
netflix$type <- as.factor(netflix$type)
netflix$country <- as.factor(netflix$country)
netflix$date_added <- mdy(netflix$date_added)
netflix$release_year <- as.factor(netflix$release_year)
netflix$rating <- as.factor(netflix$rating)
netflix$listed_in <- as.factor(netflix$listed_in)
str(netflix)
```
## Explorations Let us determine whether Netflix has been more focused on TV
shows or movies.
```{r}
type_counts <- table(netflix$type)
barplot(type_counts,
        main = "Movies vs TV Shows",
        xlab = "Type",
        ylab = "Count",
        col = "dark blue",
        cex.main = 2,
        cex.lab = 1.5,
        border = NA,
        axes = FALSE)
# Adding a box around the plot
box()
```
***Netflix is more focus on Movies***
We will then create visualizations for the top nations that Netflix targets with
its movies and TV shows. First, we will create a new dataframe for just movies
```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)
# Assuming your data frame is named 'netflix_movies'
movies <- netflix %>%
  filter(type == "Movie") %>%
  filter(country != "") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(number = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(number)) %>%
  slice(1:10)
# Display the movies data frame
head(movies)
# Create a bar plot
# Setting up the margins to accommodate large text
par(mar = c(12, 5, 5, 2)) # Adjust bottom margin to fit long country names
# Create the bar plot
barplot(
  height = movies$number,
  names.arg = movies$country,
  main = "Top Ten Countries - Movies",
  xlab = "",
  ylab = "Number of Movies",
  col = "dark blue",
  las = 2, # Rotate x-axis labels
  cex.names = 1.5, # Adjust size of x-axis labels
  cex.main = 2, # Adjust size of the title
  cex.lab = 1.5 # Adjust size of the axis labels
)
# Adding a box around the plot
box()
```
## Duplicate Dataz Duplicate Data 
```{r} 
duplicates <- duplicated(netflix) 
netflix[duplicates, ]  
sum(duplicated(netflix)) 

netflix[duplicated(netflix$title), ] 
sum(duplicated(netflix$title, ))

netflix[duplicated(netflix$director), ] 
sum(duplicated(netflix$director, ))
```
## Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
